Second, Tom & Thomas created a prototype which had much to do with literally pasting together the cards on a standard card game deck and play away to iron out the kinks, and make the game not only easy to learn, but exciting to play. And what could be cooler than outsmarting your friends and making a shitload of money?\n\nBut we also wanted to up the stakes with a title to be claimed only by the winner. And so, \"The Greatest Investor\" was born."}}},"content_for_index":[]}}
